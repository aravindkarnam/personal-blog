### Context
[@urbanpiper](https://urbanpiper.com), the company where I'm currently working at as a Product manager, makes a suite of products for managaging different aspects of a restaurant businesses. At the core of every restaurant business is it's kitchen inventory. Raw material stocks must be tracked properly to ensure there's minimum wastage, sufficient availability of stocks to meet the demand and overall profitablity of the restaurant. 

An Inventory management software works very simply. When you receive raw materails at your warehouse/godown, workers enter that data (name, quantity, prices) in the software. When the raw materials are consumed in the kitchen to make food items on the menu software automatically decrements stocks in your kitchen. Similarly when you throw away spoilt materails, staff should decrement your stocks as wastage. That's it. Business owners get nice reports on cost of goods sold, item-wise profitability, wastage by staff and if there's any theft in the stores. 

Inventory management software is usually bundled as an add-on along with core products like point of sale, accounting, online order management etc and sold as a suite of products.

### Problem
In early 2022, we were targetting Small and medium business(SMB) to sell our suite and pretty much giving away all the add-on modules for free. While core modules like Point of sale and online orders were being heavily adopted, there was no adoption in the inventory management software. It's not like SMBs don't need this product, in-fact they need it the most because raw materail prices are very fluctuating and inflationary effects felt strongly by small operations (as opposed to enterprices). Lack of adoption was not due to discoverability or missing user education, since a demo was given at the time of onboarding while benefits were also explained. 

My finding for this rather poor adoption was that inventory software is the hardest to setup in our whole suite and especially the part that's called the "Recipes". Recipies tie the raw materails to items on the menu. For example:
